/*
Optimized version of DGEMM using C intrinsics to generate the AVX512.

To demonstrate the performance impact of subwordparallelism, we rerun the code
using AVX. While compiler writers may eventually be able to routinely produce
high-quality code that uses the AVX instructions of the x86, for now we must
`cheat` by using C intrinsics that more or less tell the compiler exactly how to
produce good code.

Th declaration uses the __m512d data type, which tells the compiler the
variable will hold 8 double-precision floating-point values (8 Ã— 64 bits =
512 bits). The intrinsic _mm512_load_pd() uses AVX
instructions to load 8 double-precision floating-point numbers in parallel ( _pd
) from the matrix C into c0. The address calculation C+i+j*n represents element
C[i+j*n]. Symmetrically, the final step uses the intrinsic _mm512_store_pd() to
store 8 double-precision floating-point numbers from c0 into the matrix C. As we
are going through 8 elements each iteration, the outer for loop increments `i`
by 8.

Inside the loops, we first load 8 elements of A again using
_mm512_ load_pd(). To multiply these elements by one element of B, we
first use the intrinsic _mm512_broadcast_sd(), which makes eight identical
copies of the scalar double precision number (in this case an element of B)
in one of the ZMM registers. We then use _mm512_fmadd_pd to
multiply the 8 double-precision results in parallel and then add the 8
products to the 8 sums in c0.
